<h1>THE HISTORY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS</h1>
<br>
<body>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">The first computers did not have operating systems. However,
software tools for managing the system and simplifying the
use of hardware appeared very quickly afterwards, and
gradually expanded in scope.<br>
• “Preparing ENIAC for a series of runs was an incredibly
involved process. First, detailed instructions had to be written
defining the problem and a procedure for solving it.<br>
• These instructions were programmed by adjusting switches
manually and inserting thousands of cables into as many as
forty large plug boards.

<h3>Compare Operating Systems</h3>
<p>Terms often used when comparing operating systems:<br><br>
• Multi-user – Two or more users can work with programs and
share peripheral devices, such as printers, at the same time.<br>
• Multi-tasking – The computer is capable of operating multiple
applications at the same time.<br>
• Multi-processing – The computer can have two or more central
processing units (CPUs) that programs share.<br>
• Multi-threading – A program can be broken into smaller parts
that can be loaded as needed by the operating system.<br> Multithreading allows individual programs to be multi-tasked.</p>
<br>
<h4>Standalone / Desktop OS</h4>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">Desktop operating systems:<br><br>
– Microsoft Windows: Windows XP<br>
– Macintosh: Mac OS<br>
– Linux: Fedora, Ubuntu, and others<br>
– UNIX : free BSD<br><br>
• A desktop OS has the following
characteristics:<br><br>
– Supports a single user<br>
– Runs single-user applications<br>
– Shares files and folders on a small<br>
network with limited security</p>
<br>
<h5>Network Operating Systems (NOS</h5>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">Common NOS include:<br><br>
– Novell Netware<br>
– Microsoft Windows Server<br>
– Linux<br>
– UNIX<br><br>
• A network OS has the following
characteristics:<br><br>
– Supports multiple users<br>
– Runs multi-user applications<br>
– Is robust and redundant<br>
– Provides increased security compared to desktop operating systems.</p>

<h6>Roles of an Operating System.</h6>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px"> All computers rely on an operating system (OS)
to provide the interface for interaction between
users, applications, and hardware.
• The operating system boots the computer and
manages the file system.
• Almost all modern operating systems can
support more than one user, task, or CPU.
• The operating system has four main roles: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Control hardware access</li>
<li> Manage files and folders</li>
<li>Provide user interface</li>
<li>Manage applications</li>
</ul>
