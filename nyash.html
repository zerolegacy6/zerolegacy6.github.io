<h4>Welcome to Nyakasura School</h4>
Nyakasura School is a boarding secondary school with both ordinary and advanced levels located in Nyakasura, off the Fort Portal-Bundibugyo Road,<br> approximately 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi), by road, northwest of the central business district of Fort Porta town, Kabarole District in Western Uganda.<br>
‘To Minister and not to be Ministered Unto’, Nyakasura School has produced Ugandans who have benefited the country for the services they offer.<br>Nyakasura School was founded by a Scotsman, Lieutenant Commander Ernest Ebohard Calwell, a retired naval officer, in 1926. Mr. Calwell was a<br> teacher at King’s College Budo before he fell out with the headmaster there. Two students from Toro Kingdom at Buddo at that time, by the names <br>of Komwiswa and Byara convinced Mr. Calwell to come and ask the Omukama of Toro for land to set up a school like Buddo in Toro.
Rukirabasaija <br>Daudi Kasagama Kyebambe III showed the Commander three sites, out of which he selected Nyakasura. He selected Scottish kilts as the boys’ uniform.<br> Some people think they are boys in skirts which is not the case. “We don’t have shorts but Kilts, for ‘O’ level, the boys are very proud and some old <br>boys turn up with them during reunions”<br>
