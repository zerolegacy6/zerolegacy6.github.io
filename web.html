<h1>THE HISTORY OF OPERATING SYSTEMS</h1>
<br>
<body>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">The first computers did not have operating systems. However,
software tools for managing the system and simplifying the
use of hardware appeared very quickly afterwards, and
gradually expanded in scope.<br>
• “Preparing ENIAC for a series of runs was an incredibly
involved process. First, detailed instructions had to be written
defining the problem and a procedure for solving it.<br>
• These instructions were programmed by adjusting switches
manually and inserting thousands of cables into as many as
forty large plug boards.
• A team of five operators might work several days on the
external wiring and many more days searching for errors and
correcting them.By the early 1960s, commercial computer vendors
were supplying quite extensive tools for streamlining
the development, scheduling, and execution of jobs on
batch processing systems.<br>
Examples were produced by UNIVAC and Control Data
Corporation, amongst others.
• Through the 1960s, several major concepts were
developed, driving the development of operating
systems.<br> The development of the IBM System/360
produced a family of mainframe computers available in
widely differing capacities and price points, for which a
single operating system OS/360 was planned.Another key development was the concept of time-sharing: the idea of
sharing the resources of expensive computers amongst multiple computer
users interacting in real time with the system. Time sharing allowed all of
the users to have the illusion of having exclusive access to the machine;
the Multics timesharing system was the most famous of a number of new
operating systems developed to take advantage of the concept.<br>
• Multics, particularly, was an inspiration to a number of operating systems
developed in the 1970s, notably Unix. Another commercially-popular
minicomputer operating system was VMS.<br>
• The first microcomputers did not have the capacity or need for the
elaborate operating systems that had been developed for mainframes and
minis; minimalistic operating systems were developed.
• One notable early operating system was CP/M, which was supported on
many early microcomputers and was largely cloned in creating MS-DOS,
which became wildly popular as the operating system chosen for the IBM
PC.By the 1990s, the microcomputer had evolved to the point where, as well as extensive
GUI facilities, the robustness and flexibility of operating systems of larger computers
became increasingly desirable.<br>
• Microsoft's response to this change was the development of Windows NT, which
served as the basis for Microsoft's entire operating system line starting in 1999.
• Apple rebuilt their operating system on top of a Unix core as Mac OS X, released in
2001.
• Hobbyist-developed reimplementations of Unix, assembled with the tools from the
GNU project, also became popular; versions based on the Linux kernel are by far the
most popular, with the BSD derived UNIXes holding a small portion of the server
market.<br>
Today, Command line interface (or CLI) operating systems can operate using only the keyboard
for input.
• Modern OS's use a mouse for input with a graphical user interface (GUI) sometimes
implemented as a shell. The appropriate OS may depend on the hardware architecture,
specifically the CPU, with only Linux and BSD running on almost any CPU</p>

<h2>Types of operating systems</h2>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Standalone OS<li>
<li>Desktop OS</li>
<p style="text-indent:0"> Single user OS which are generally used by personal
users for desktop applications, e.g;<br><br> DOS. Windows 3x.<br>
Windows 9x.<br> Windows xp. windows 7. etc.</p>
<br>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Network OS</li>
<p style= "text-indent:0">They are multi-user and time-sharing OS. The entire
network operating system support multiprocessing and
multitasking features, e.g;<br><br> UNIX, Novell.<br> Windows NT.<br>
Windows 2000/2003/2005/2008 server, etc.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Compare Operating Systems</h3>
<p>Terms often used when comparing operating systems:<br><br>
• Multi-user – Two or more users can work with programs and
share peripheral devices, such as printers, at the same time.<br>
• Multi-tasking – The computer is capable of operating multiple
applications at the same time.<br>
• Multi-processing – The computer can have two or more central
processing units (CPUs) that programs share.<br>
• Multi-threading – A program can be broken into smaller parts
that can be loaded as needed by the operating system.<br> Multithreading allows individual programs to be multi-tasked.</p>
<br>
<h4>Standalone / Desktop OS</h4>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">Desktop operating systems:<br><br>
– Microsoft Windows: Windows XP<br>
– Macintosh: Mac OS<br>
– Linux: Fedora, Ubuntu, and others<br>
– UNIX : free BSD<br><br>
• A desktop OS has the following
characteristics:<br><br>
– Supports a single user<br>
– Runs single-user applications<br>
– Shares files and folders on a small<br>
network with limited security</p>
<br>
<h5>Network Operating Systems (NOS</h5>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px">Common NOS include:<br><br>
– Novell Netware<br>
– Microsoft Windows Server<br>
– Linux<br>
– UNIX<br><br>
• A network OS has the following
characteristics:<br><br>
– Supports multiple users<br>
– Runs multi-user applications<br>
– Is robust and redundant<br>
– Provides increased security compared to desktop operating systems.</p>

<h6>Roles of an Operating System.</h6>
<p style= "text-indent: 30px"> All computers rely on an operating system (OS)
to provide the interface for interaction between
users, applications, and hardware.
• The operating system boots the computer and
manages the file system.
• Almost all modern operating systems can
support more than one user, task, or CPU.
• The operating system has four main roles: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Control hardware access</li>
<li> Manage files and folders</li>
<li>Provide user interface</li>
<li>Manage applications</li>
</ul>
